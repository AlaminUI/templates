         <p><strong>Bob S.</strong> in Waterford, CT<br>
           <em>Project: Built Garapa Deck</em><br>
           &quot;Fred Zimmerman was referred to us in conversation by a  family member as Fred's crew had done her fence. My wife and I had several  contractors provide an estimate for the demolition/re-construction and  expansion of our presently small deck. Fred stood out from the rest - no fancy  trucks with allot of signs etc., no embroidered shirts, very low key. <br>
           <br>
           Fred knew immediately during our conversation what I wanted  and explained how he would do it verses the other contractors who appeared to  dismiss me.<br>
           <br>
           Told Fred during conversation that I was not chasing him  around and that I was a communicator and wanted the same in return. We were off  and running - sketch/plans to Town Hall - permits pulled - holes dug for sono  tubes etc. Fred and his crew consisting of Ryan and Jonathan were clearly a  great choice! <br>
           <br>
           Communicated the entire time when they could be at my house -  when they were leaving etc. I agreed to pick-up and arrange for materials,  however if something was needed that I neglected - Fred took care of it and  provided a detailed receipt with an explanation as to why he needed it.<br>
           <br>
           These guys, particularly Ryan are truly artisans of  carpentry. If an error was made it was immediately brought to my attention and  not covered up. The error was taken care of and we moved on. Ryan and Jonathan  complimented each other as skilled craftsman. Fred could take off and run his  business and know that these guys were doing their job and taking pride in  their craftsmanship. <br>
           <br>
           Unfortunately during the three week period, weather became a  factor - however each one of them made an effort to come back to work more of  the project and always ensuring that my wife and I were happy with what they  did. Without a doubt they built this deck as if they owned it and took great  pride in doing so. Any questions I had or suggestions - we worked through it  and I was never dismissed. We became very comfortable with Fred and his team  and after our experience - we will miss them as they are not just contractors,  they became our friends.<br>
           <br>
         Fred, the best to you and the guys and always keep your  craftsmanship at the level you provided us with. Professional job - true  craftsman - honest - hard working...&quot;</p>

         <p><strong>Shelley G.</strong> in Old Lyme, CT<br>
           <em>Project: Cleaned a Roof</em><br>
         &quot;We are living in Florida and needed our cottage roof in   CT cleaned in order to sell it. I got Fred's name from Home Advisor and   would recommend him and his company highly. Prompt, neat, courteous and   reasonable!!&quot;</p>

         <p><strong>Walter N.</strong> in East Lyme, CT<br>
           <em>Project: Repaired an Asphalt Shingle Roof</em><br>
         &quot;I was impressed with Fred's quick response on a weekend   (several other contractors that I asked to bid did not respond for   another two days). As we discussed work to be done, it became clear that   Fred was thinking of ways to get needed work done at a reasonable   price. I appreciated that he was not trying to pad extras into the   estimate to see whether I would object. I have other repair projects   that need to be done, and I will definitely be calling on Fred.&quot;</p>
